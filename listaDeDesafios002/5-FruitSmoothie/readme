5) Fruit Smoothie

Create a class Smoothie and do the following:

Create a constructor property called ingredients.
Create a getCost method which calculates the total cost of the ingredients used to make the smoothie.
Create a getPrice method which returns the number from getCost plus the number from getCost multiplied by 1.5. Round to two decimal places.
Create a getName method which gets the ingredients and puts them in alphabetical order into a nice descriptive sentence. If there are multiple ingredients, add the word "Fusion" to the end but otherwise, add "Smoothie". Remember to change "-berries" to "-berry". See the examples below.
