9) -  Creating a world challenge
For this challenge, your tasks are to finish designing three classes: World, City, and Citizen.

For this task, finish the code below so that:

1 - the program successfully creates a 'world' object
2 - the program successfully adds 100 cities into the world object using add_city method.
3 - your program should create these cities with random city name that's 5 characters long and composed of alphabets (use lowercase).
4 - when a new city is created, it automatically adds 50 citizens to the city, with each citizen having a random age between 0 to 100.
                                          
World class needs to have

1 - a method called add_city - where you can pass the city name and it adds to its list
2 - an attribute called cities - where this would be an array containing all the city object
3 - constructor(num) - that creates num number of cities. for example new World(50) should create 50 new cities and store this.
4 - a method called random_city - where it pulls out a random city object
5 - a method called total_cities() - that returns the total number of cities in this world

City needs to have

1 - constructor(name) - that creates a new city with the given 'name' or if 'name' is blank, it can automatically create a random city name that's 5 characters long and composed of lowercase alphabets.
2 - a method called add_citizen - where you can create a new citizen
3 - an attribute called citizens - where this would be an array containing all the citizen objects

Citizen needs to have

1 - a constructor
2 - when a new citizen is created, it needs to automatically assign a random age (between 0 to 100)

The code structure can be:


class World {
}

class City {
}

class Citizen {
}
//create a world with 100 cities
let world = new World(100);

//adds a new city called 'hackerhero'
world.add_city('hackerhero');

//should pull out a random city object within the world and log its value
console.log('Random city name: ', world.random_city().name);
